# Harbour Safe Dashboard

Harbour Safe Dashboard is a web application for managing [Safe](https://safe.global/) multisig wallets. It allows users to:

- View Safe configuration and owners
- Enqueue new transactions for a Safe
- View and sign pending transactions
- Execute transactions once enough signatures are collected
- All actions are performed client-side, with no external backend dependencies

Pending transactions and signatures are stored on-chain in the Harbour ([SafeInternationalHarbour](../contracts/src/SafeInternationalHarbour.sol)) smart contract deployed to Gnosis Chain. As long as the chain is running and an RPC endpoint is available, transactions can be enqueued and executedâ€”no additional backend or off-chain indexer is required.

## Getting Started

## Smart Contract

This app interacts with the [`SafeInternationalHarbour.sol`](../contracts/src/SafeInternationalHarbour.sol) contract, found in the [`@contracts`](../contracts) package of this monorepo.

**Deployed contract address:** [`0x5E669c1f2F9629B22dd05FBff63313a49f87D4e6`](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x5E669c1f2F9629B22dd05FBff63313a49f87D4e6) on [Gnosis Chain](https://gnosisscan.io/).

**Note:** This application also depends on the [multicall3](https://github.com/mds1/multicall) contract to be available on the chains being used.

## Environment Variables

- The app consumes environment variables via Vite (`import.meta.env`).
- Copy `webapp/.env.example` to `.env` (or `.env.local`) and adjust the values.
- The following variables are recognised:

```bash
# Where the app will be served (prefixing route paths). Useful for GitHub Pages
VITE_BASE_PATH=/harbour/

# WalletConnect Cloud project ID (get one at https://cloud.walletconnect.com)
VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=<your WC Cloud project-id>
```

> **Tip**: For development you can leave `VITE_BASE_PATH` at `/`.
